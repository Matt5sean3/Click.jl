# Click.jl
Julia package to allow simpler interaction with graphics

## Image Maps
The simplest application of this library is to create a click map for a static 
image that is loaded into a GUI. Create the image map and connect it to the 
underlying GUI using this package as seen below for Gtk.

```julia
using Click
using Gtk

# TODO Gtk support still a work in progress
```
